## Large Language Model Reasoning Evaluation Framework
_life is chaotic, this goes slower than expected. for ideas/thoughts, lmk_
### Project Overview
Assess and interpret reasoning capabilities of large language models

### Core Research Objectives

**Reasoning Assessment Dimensions**
- **Logical Reasoning**: evaluation of deductive and inductive reasoning
- **Causal Inference**: mapping reasoning pathways and decision-making processes
- **Semantic Understanding**: analyzing depth and nuance of contextual comprehension / text prompts
- **Multimodal testing / Input-structure variation**: TBD
- ** ... **: TBD

### Methodological Approach

#### Interpretability Techniques
- **Mechanistic Interpretability**
  - Neuron-level level/ Attention mechanism visualization / ..

- **Explainability Frameworks**
  - Gradient-based mapping, LIME, SHAP (todo: cite)

### Evaluation Metrics

**Reasoning Performance Indicators**

| Metric                 | Description                              | Measurement Approach                     |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|

### Future Directions
- Advanced multi-modal reasoning evaluations
- Cross-model comparative studies
- Development of novel interpretability techniques
